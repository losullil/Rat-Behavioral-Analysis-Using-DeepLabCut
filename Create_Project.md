It is time to create your project. Go to the "Manage Projects" tab in the upper left corner of the GUI screen. Make sure that "Create New Project" is bubbled in, then enter the name of your project. DO NOT INCLUDE SPACES!!! This will create problems later on. Then, load the videos you want to run your training on by clicking the "load videos" button. After all that, click "Create Project". After some loading time, a bunch more tabs should pop up on the GUI. You can also view the project in the HPC browser. A new folder should be created automatically!
