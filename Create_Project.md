It is time to create your project. Go to the "Manage Projects" tab in the upper left corner of the GUI screen. Make sure that "Create New Project" is bubbled in, then enter the name of your project. DO NOT INCLUDE SPACES!!! This will create problems later on. Then, load the videos you want to run your training on by clicking the "load videos" button. After all that, click "Create Project". After some loading time, a bunch more tabs should pop up on the GUI. You can also view the project in the HPC browser. A new folder should be created automatically!

Once your new project has been created, you can check it out in the interactive HPC interface. A new project folder with your project name, your name, and the date should pop up! You can open this folder and see that DLC has also automatically created a few other subdirectories for your use. I would not reccomend altering the names of these subdirectories--that can get very confusing later on.

The only real file that will populate these folders at this point is the sample video that you uploaded. Personally, I start with one sample video so as not to overwhelm the program. Check experimental records to make sure that this sample video does not have any outlier occurences (playback errors, particularly distressed rat, etc.).
