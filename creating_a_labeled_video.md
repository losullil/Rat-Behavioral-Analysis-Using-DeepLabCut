After you have trained, analyzed, and evaluated your first iteration, you may want to create a labeled video to visualize how well the markings are. This step is not essential, but can be a good way to document your progress. This step requires the MOST interaction with terminal, but if you just follow my commands, it is not too hard. 

Pull up DeepLabCut on the MATE terminal. DON'T launch the GUI; you will not be able to interact with the terminal if you do so. If you do, simply enter Ctrl C. 
Then, you will define the config path. For example, 

$ config = '/mnt/research/jhoneycu/losulliv/KAT_OFT_R/KAT_OFT_R-lucyosullivan-2022-09-17/config.yaml'

Be sure to include that final quotation mark, I always forget!
