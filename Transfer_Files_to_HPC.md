Once you have created a folder in the HPC, you can create another folder where you can put videos you want to be analyzed. For example, my first folder is called "KAT_OFT". NOTE: Try NOT to include spaces in any of your folder names! It will make things much harder later on. 

To transfer files from the DropBox, I used a bit of a workaround to compensate for a) not enough storage space on my computer and b) a lack of a harddrive. First, log in to Jenn's Dropbox (or wherever you have stored your videos). Reach out the Jenn for login information! 

Once you are in the Dropbox, navigate to the folder with the videos you wish to analyze. It would be ideal to then download all the videos to a harddrive, then drag them into the open folder on the HPC grid. However, I opted to download them locally 10 at a time.

Then, I dragged those 10 videos into the HPC folder. After they loaded in the HPC folder (check that the size is not --), I deleted them locally and repeated this process. A bit tedious, but it got the job done! 

Once the videos are in the desired folder, _you need to rename them and keep track of which video is which_. I would recommend creating a spreadsheet with the video's initial name and condition, then it's new name. The new name should be relatively short and contain no spaces. For example, we renamed "K13 2021-08-14_10-01-40.mp4" to "OFT_1.mp4". Later, when you are making file paths to these videos, a shorter name will be super helpful. 

Now, you should have a folder full of videos to analyze! I looked at them in .mp4 format, but DLC also recognizes .avi, too. If you haven't done so already, select 1-3 videos to perform initial training on. Ideally, don't select a video where the rat was noted for having outlier behavior. 

Now, onto launching DeepLabCut on the HPC!
