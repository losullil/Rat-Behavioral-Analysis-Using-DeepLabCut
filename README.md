# Rat-Behavioral-Analysis-Using-DeepLabCut
A tool for the Honeycutt Lab at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine. Based on Bowdoin's Dependencies. 

Welcome to a beginners introduction to using DeepLabCut for the Honeycutt Lab! DLC and other softwares can be super daunting, and a lot of people have the misconception that they need a strong computer science background to be able to use these complex softwares. This is not true! These softwares are designed for widespread use (though it would take a strong CS background if you were to actually create them). I truly believe that softwares like this are the next step in scientific research. A LOT of labs look for expertise in softwares like these! Good luck, and if you have questions, feel free to reach out to me at luciamarieosullivan@gmail.com.
