Slurm is a part of the HPC Grid of Bowdoin. The HPC has graphical processing units, or GPUs, which are the reason why advanced video analysis like this is even possible. Before we submit to the grid, we have to prepare some files under our project folder. 

First, we have to create a .py and .sh file to command the program to submit to the HPC. I have created two samples in this repository, you can copy them yourself with your own specifications using the "edit" feature of the HPC interactive interface.
