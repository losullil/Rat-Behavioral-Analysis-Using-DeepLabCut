The first step is to get set up with Bowdoin's High-Powered Computing Grid, or HPC. Basically, the HPC as a bunch of computers that are hooked together to make one "super computer". This super computer can process jobs in hours that would take your ordinary computer days. With the Bowdoin HPC interface, we can easily access this computing power. A huge shoutout to Dj Merrill, Bowdoin's HPC coordinator, for all of his help with this process. 

**Connecting to the HPC**

You will need to be either connected to Bowdoin's Wifi or on a VPN in order to access the HPC interface. If you have not yet installed a VPN, you can do so with [these instructions](https://bowdoin.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/1814/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=99743#:~:text=Enter%20your%20Bowdoin%20username%20on,%22Second%20Password%3A%22%20field.&text=By%20entering%20push%2C%20the%20Duo,then%20allow%20VPN%20to%20connect.). 

**Creating a Folder**

Once you are on Bowdoin Wifi, you can enter the HPC interface for research. [This link](https://hpcweb.bowdoin.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/files/fs/mnt/research) will lead you to the research section of the HPC (you may have to log in to your Bowdoin account to enter this page). You should see something like this.

Scroll down on this page, and click on the "jhoneycu" folder. This is Professor Honeycutt's section! 

If you have not done so already, you need to have a folder created inside Jenn's (you should see my folder there already, under losulliv). To do this, email Dj Merril (deej@bowdoin.edu) and cc Jenn for approval. Try to get a sense of how much storage space you will need for your project (my very large project was created with 100 GB). It will take ~1 day to create this folder. If you try to access it before it is fully created, you will not be able to! 

Once it is created, yay! You are ready to start moving files into the HPC!
